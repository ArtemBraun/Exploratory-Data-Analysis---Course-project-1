# Exploratory Data Analysis - Course project 1 <br />
## Peer-graded Assignment <br />
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”. <br />
<br />
Overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. <br />
<br />
Task was to reconstruct the provided plots, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system. <br />
<br />
There are four R code files in the repository (Plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R, Plot3.R) that constructs the corresponding plots (Plot1.png, Plot2.png, Plot3.png, Plot4.png), i.e. code in Plot1.R constructs the Plot1.png plot. <br />
<br />
Code files include code for reading the data as well, so the plots are fully reproduced. <br />
